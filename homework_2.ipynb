    "## A Twitter-Mentioning Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic PageRank approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find significant Twitter users. So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Twitter users and their mentions of other Twitter users (so user = node, mention of another user = edge). Over this Twitter-user graph, we can apply the PageRank approach to order the users. The main idea is that a user who is mentioned by other users is more \"impactful\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **userID**: diane, **text**: \"@bob Howdy!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: charlie, **text**: \"Welcome @bob and @alice!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: bob, **text**: \"Hi @charlie and @alice!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: alice, **text**: \"Howdy!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four short tweets generated by four users. The @mentions between users form a directed graph with four nodes and five edges. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node. Note that a retweet also contain the \"@\", so it should be counted as a mention as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the tweets in the file we provide called *pagerank.json*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The edges are binary and directed. If Bob mentions Alice once, in 10 tweets, or 10 times in one tweet, there is an edge from Bob to Alice, but there is not an edge from Alice to Bob.\n",
    "* If a user mentions herself, ignore it.\n",
    "* Correctly parsing @mentions in a tweet is error-prone. Use the entities field.\n",
    "* Later you will need to implement the PageRank algorithm on the graph you build here.\n"

    "For this part, your goal is to put on your \"[search engine optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)\" hat. Your job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query: **awcv9kjlh scwrlkjf4e** --- two terms, lower case, no quote. As of today (Feb 7, 2017), there are no hits for this query on either Google or Bing. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, you know that several factors may impact a page's rank. Your goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.\n",

    "* Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard blog platform (e.g., wordpress), or some other primarily user-controlled page\n",
    "* Your target page CAN NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a Yahoo Answers or similar page\n",

We will issue the query and check the rankings at some undetermined time in the next couple of weeks. You might guess that major search engines take some time to discover and integrate new pages: if I were you, I'd get a target page up immediately.\n",
